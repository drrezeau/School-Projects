Compound interest is a truly amazing principle.

What seems so simple mathematically can have almost miraculous results.

If you save $1000 a year for 10 years with no interest
you will end up with $10,000 in the bank. If that money were
invested at 8% interest, compounded quarterly, you would have 
$15,402.51 at the end of the time.

Thatâ€™s quite a difference, but now consider investing the same amount
over a period of 40 years. With no interest you would see $40,000
but with 8% interest, compounded quarterly, you would
have $290,316.31 in the bank!
